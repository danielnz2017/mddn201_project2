					<p class="mainp"><b>Based on the proposal from project 1, I have decided to create a website
							prototype
							for
							internet topics.
							The website will briefly talk about what is internet, how does it work and online privacy.
							User
							will
							be
							able to discuss the relevant topics anonymously at the end.

							Purpose: The purpose of this website is to explain the internet in general and its risks in
							a
							simple
							and
							easy way because currently there are many online articles that talk about internet and
							online
							privacy
							but most of those articles are long and very technical. Internet is not built just for IT
							experts;
							internet is for everyone to use. Therefore, I would like to build a website that can be a
							potential
							solution for it.

							User Goals: The website aims to inform users about the how does the internet work and the
							common
							risks
							of online personal details being collected, traced or exposed. Also, the website also aims
							to
							provide a
							platform for internet users to discuss their thoughts and opinions.

							Audience: Anyone who wants to know or just interested in some basic stuff of the internet
							and
							maybe
							like
							to share their opinions and thoughts as well.</b>

							“interesting journey” rather than “painful readings”. I made those colour bars around the

							a button that links to the first page as a “disconnect” button for exit purpose. And then I
							used

							bunch of social media icons and rainbows to represent the ‘fun’ part of the internet.
							However,
							instead of use round button as I planned, I used a rectangle button. User can proceed to
							next
							page
